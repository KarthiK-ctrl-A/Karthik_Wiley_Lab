 - The software development life cycle is a structured
process that enables the production of high quality, in
the shortest possible production time

- Planning -> analysis -> Design -> implementation ->

	^--	Maintenance    <-

FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

- SRS - Software Requirement Specification
  it contains requirements for the req of clients
  2 types of req , funcitonal and non-function

Functional req - they are tech features of project
 ex - booking form, login form, profle etc

Non-Functional req - which are indirect to consumner
 ex - website to be reliable, fast, UI/UX should be nice
etc which are indirectly related to project


DESIGN

 - 2 types - High levl and Low level

HLD - talks about architecture or infrastructure of project
LLD - talks about module level or detailed description
of every module
 - UML diagrams

IMPLEMENTATION

OOP - Object oriented programming
- coding

VERIFICATION / TESITNG

 - Black Box, white Box, System, integration and Unit testing
	user acceptance tesing

MAINTENANCE / DEPLOYMENT

SDLC MODELS

 - Waterfall model
	req - design - impl - verifi - maintenance
	- simple
	- easy to implement
	- suitable for small projects
	- Not ideal for large/compkex softwares
	- Each phase req lot of time

 - Iterative Model
	- same phases as waterfall , but repeatetive
	  inception - req gathering,
	  elaboration - design, 
	  construction - implement and test, 
	  transition - Maintenance & deployment 

	- softwares are developed in small scale
	- every build is a prototype or updated version/
		new release of software
	-  any change/ req can be incorporated in new cycle
	-  risk can be identified early
	-  defects can be identifies at early stage
	-  product is divided in modules/chunks , and easy to manage

 - Prototype Model
	- req -> design -> Prototype -> eval -> refine -> final
	- 
  
- spiral Model
	- Risk Factors 
		- Inadequate estimation of project time
			difficult to estimate req time cost etc
		- Unrealistic Schedule
			may exceed delivery time in turn incrrease cost
		- Unrealistic Budget
			may depend on budget, time and effort
		- Unclear Project Scope
			may fail if goal is not understood
		- Insufficient Project resources
			may fail for insufficient tools, tech,etc

	- Phases in spiral model
	  	1 - objective
	  	2 - risk analysis
	  	3 - Engineering
	  	4 - Evaluation
 - AGILE - ability to respond to changes
 - CHALLENGES IN SDLC
	- management/schedule
	- communication during initial phase [ with customer]
	- Development
	- Late request
	- crunch time for testing software
	  solution - Agile method

===================================================================	

AGILE METHOD - philosophy

 - agile follows iterative and team based approach
 - also known as cross functional team
 - Objective of agile is to quickly deliver the product
	with functional components
 - Agile means ability to respond to changes [req of client]
 - In agile development team directly interacts with customer
 - in agile, each iteration lasts from 1-3 weeks 
 - software is delivered in multiple increments
 
==================================================================
SCRUM - USED TO IMPLEMENT AGILE PHIL

 - it is a subset of agile / implementation of agile
 - it is a project managment system
 - it is a lightweight process framework for agile development
 - BENEFITS
	 - increased quality of the deliverables
	 - cope with changes
	 - better estimates while spending less time 
	 - more control of the peroject schedule and state
 - scrum can control software and product development
 - uses iterative incremental practice
 - increases productivity
 - it is not restricted to software development projects
 - 

-------------SCRUM MANIFESTO------------------------------------
	
	    AGILE                 OVER        SDLC

 - individual and interaction   OVER   process and tools
 - working software             OVER   comprehensive doc
 - customer collaboration       OVER   contract negotiation
 - Responding to changes        OVER   following a plan


------------------SCRUM ROLES----------------------------------

 - PRODUCT OWNER : product sponsor [who pays money]
	=> decides what are features requires in software
	=> decides relese dates, priority of features and budget

 - SCRUM MASTER : typically a project manager/ team leader
   	=> Responsible for enacting scrum values and practices
   	=> Remove impedements, politics and keep everyone productive
 
 - PROJECT TEAM : 5 - 10 members, varies from org to org, generally
			cross functional, programer, UI/UX etc
	=> No member is allowed to leave or change team during current
	   iteration of development
	=> 

 - SPRINT : complete develpment lifecyclee of 1 iteration

 - PRODUCT BACKLOG : list of features which are decided to 
   be added in software in current lifecycle

 - SPRINT BACKLOG : features that couldnt be added in project
   in current iteration after sprint

 - DAILY SCRUM MEETINGS
	=> daily 15 min standup meeting
	=> Not for problem solving
	=> everyone from team is invited
	=> only team member , owner, ,aster can talk
	=> what you do ?, you will do ?, what are obstacles ?

 - After each sprint, BURNDOWN chart is prepared
     burn down - horozontal - slowly
 
 - SPRINT REVIEW : happends at the end of sprint/ iteration
	=> team explains, what i had accomplished during the sprint
	=> Typically demo of the software is presented
	=> 2-4 hrs of duration
	=> whole team participates, all other members are also 
		invited, ex: acc,sales, legal, finance etc

CLOUD COMPUTING

 - cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the 
   internet - storage, networking, servers, analytics, intelligence
 - Cloud can be used for
	- dev new apps
	- storage, recovery etc
	- host blogs, websites
	- delivery of softwares on demand
	- data analysis
	- streaming videos
	- Data Governance
 - Benefits of Cloud Computing
	- Cost
	- Speed	
	- enhances productivity
	- reliability
	- security
 

----------------------------------------------------------------

 - Hypervisor is required to host OS
 - Types of hypervisors:
	- Type 1:
		=> Which run directly on hardware
		=> VMware ESXI, XEN / Citrix
	- Type 2:
		=> instaalled on top of OS
		=> VMware Fusion, Oracle VMware

TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES

IAAS - It is also known as cloud infrastructre services. It is responsible
 for managing applications data, middleware, and runtime environments.
Ex - AWS-EC2, compute engine, etc


PAAS - 


SAAS


=============================================================


VCS - Version Control System
 - It records changes to a file or set of files over tiem so that you
can recall specific version later
 - allows to work together
 - VCS is a collection of software tools that help a team to manage 
changes in source code.
 - uses special kinds of DB to keep track of every modification
 - Developers can compare earlier versins of code with the older version
to fix the mistakes


Types of VCS
 - Localized
	=> keeps local copies of the files
  	=> if local computer crashes, everything is lost
 - Centralized
	=> These systems have single server that contains the versioned
		files, ans clients chekout from central place
	=> Too risk for network traffic, and if server is lost everything
		is lost
 - Distributed
	=> the user has local copy of repository
	=> the clients don't just checkout the latest snapshot of the files
		even they can fully mirror the repository
	=> The local repo contains all the files and metadata present in
		the main reposoitory

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- GIT and GITHUB
	- git commands
		=> version - git --version	
		=> to update new id --- git config --global user.name <user.name>
		=> to update mail ----- git config --global user.emaail </email/>

		=> command to make current directory as git directory	
			- git init
		=> command to mark untracked files
			- git status
		=> command to add tracker files
			- git add #filename
			or
			- git add * ///or/// git add .
		=> to commit 
			-git commit -m "message"
